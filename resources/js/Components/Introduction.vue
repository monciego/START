                    The iSTARTMO Approach is version 2.0 of START Approach first
                    published in 2019, then refined in 2023, by Dr. Jun S.
                    Camara, a faculty of Pangasinan State University,
                    Philippines. The main purpose of the START Approach is to
                    develop a research topic from which a research title could
                    be generated. Because of the progress of the approach when
                    it is pilot-tested in selected high schools, the iSTARTMO
                    was subsequently developed to include mentoring and
                    outlining.
